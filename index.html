      <p>
        This calculator uses the tropical year length – exactly <strong>31,556,925.216 seconds</strong> – to determine when you become a year older. Instead of simply using the calendar anniversary of your birth, it adds the precise number of seconds in a tropical year repeatedly until it finds the next moment that corresponds to your birthday.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since a calendar year has either 365 or 366 days, the moment when the Earth has completed one orbit around the Sun (a tropical year) does not exactly match a calendar year. This approach calculates your "true" birthday based on the Earth’s orbit.
